Lab created for CS3 class. Purpose: The Linked List is the foundation for many other data structures. By understanding
how they work from the ground up, it paves the way for understanding it’s many
variations and how its evolution into entirely new data structures.Create a new class, in a separate file named LinkedIntList.java. This class must
implement a connected list of ListNode objects, and you must not import the
built-in LinkedList class.
The list is internally implemented as a chain of linked nodes. The LinkedIntList
keeps a reference to its front (“node”) as an attribute of the class; null is at the
end of the list and a null front reference signifies an empty list.
